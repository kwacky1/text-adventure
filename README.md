â€‹Create a character and progress through the turns in a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested wasteland, while you recruit new friends and face new challenges.

You can customise a starting character with a positive and negative trait, as well as their name and a small avatar to represent them. They'll be able to form relationships with other party members, equip new weapons, and use medicine and food to combat injuries and hunger.

How long can you survive?
